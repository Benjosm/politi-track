# Project Setup Instructions

## Backend Setup
1. Installed Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip3 install poetry
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
   /home/node/.local/bin/poetry install
   ```

## Frontend Setup
1. Installed Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd client && npm install
   ```

## Verification
- Backend: `poetry run uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000` should start the server
- Frontend: `cd client && npm run dev` should start the development server

Note: Poetry was installed to /home/node/.local/bin/ since the user doesn't have sudo access. PATH was updated in .bashrc to include this directory.
