### Build Verification
Ensure clean dependency resolution:
```bash
poetry check
npm ci --dry-run
```

Verify database schema:

```

Run seeding test:
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/test_seed.py -k test_seed_row_counts
```

Test for injection protection:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>"
# Expected: HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity

## üì¶ Build & Deployment

This app is designed for **static deployment**:

1. Build frontend (`npm run build`) to generate static files in `dist/`
2. Serve via CDN or static host (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify)
3. Backend can be containerized or run serverlessly using tools like Docker or Vercel (with Python support)

No encryption, authentication, or persistent caching required.

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Completion Criteria

The project is considered complete when:
- [x] Backend starts successfully: `uvicorn server.main:app --port 8000` shows "Application startup complete"
- [x] Frontend dev server runs: `npm run dev` loads UI at `http://localhost:5173`
- [x] Search for "Alexandria" returns 3+ results (from fake data)
- [x] Clicking a profile renders the timeline with investment and vote events
- [x] All files in the project skeleton exist and contain functional code
